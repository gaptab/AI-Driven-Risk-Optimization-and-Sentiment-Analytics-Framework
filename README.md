Building an AI-powered solution for operational efficiency and sentiment analysis. It consists of the following components:

**Lead Optimization for High-Risk Accounts:**
A risk optimization model is developed using Collection, Risk, and Survival analytics to prioritize accounts with the highest likelihood of default or operational risk. The model evaluates customer attributes like payment history, due amounts, and risk scores to classify accounts into "High Risk" or "Low Risk." This helps the operations team focus on the most critical cases, improving resource allocation.

**Performance Monitoring with Dashboards:** Weekly dashboards are generated to track and visualize collection performance, including metrics like total collections and high-risk account recovery. These insights enable stakeholders to monitor trends, identify inefficiencies, and adjust strategies to enhance outcomes.

**Sentiment Analysis and Categorization of Brand News:** Sentiment analysis is performed on brand-related news articles, using machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM). The news content is classified into themes and tagged with relevant brands to gain insights into public perception. This helps in tracking brand reputation and identifying key trends or concerns.
